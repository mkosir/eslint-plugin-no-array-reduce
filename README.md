# eslint-plugin-no-array-reduce
ESLint rule to disallow `Array.reduce()` method.  
To keep you code easy to read and maintanable do yourself a favour and other developers by disallowing `Array.reduce()` method.
<!--
## Install

```bash
npm install eslint-plugin-no-array-reduce
```

and add plugin to `.eslintrc.json` file `extends` array:
```json
"extends": [
  "plugin:no-array-reduce"
],
```
-->
## Fail
```js
const groceries = [
  { name: 'milk', type: 'dairy' },
  { name: 'cheese', type: 'dairy' },
  { name: 'beef', type: 'meat' },
];

// Filter dairy products
const dairy = groceries.reduce((acc, grocery) => (grocery.type === 'dairy' ? acc.concat(grocery) : acc), []);
```
## Pass
```js
// Filter dairy products
const dairy = groceries.filter((grocery) => grocery.type === 'dairy');
```

Subjectively there are cases where you might want use it with `eslint-disable` but strongly recommended you write it differently.
